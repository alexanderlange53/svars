\title{svars: Data-driven identification of structural VAR models}
\description{
This package implements data-driven identification methods for structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models as described in Lange et al. (2021) \doi{10.18637/jss.v097.i05}.
Based on an existing VAR model object, the structural impact matrix B may be obtained
via different forms of heteroskedasticity or independent components.\cr
}
\details{
The main functions to retrieve structural impact matrices are:
\itemize{
\item \tabular{ll}{ \code{\link{id.cv}} \tab Identification via changes in volatility,}
\item \tabular{ll}{\code{\link{id.cvm}} \tab Independence-based identification of SVAR models
based on Cramer-von Mises distance,}
\item \tabular{ll}{\code{\link{id.dc}} \tab Independence-based identification of SVAR models
based on distance covariances,}
\item \tabular{ll}{\code{\link{id.garch}} \tab Identification through patterns of conditional heteroskedasticity,}
\item \tabular{ll}{\code{\link{id.ngml}} \tab Identification via Non-Gaussian maximum likelihood,}
\item \tabular{ll}{\code{\link{id.st}} \tab Identification by means of smooth transition in covariance.}
}
 All of these functions require an estimated var object. Currently the classes 'vars' and 'vec2var' from the \code{vars} package,
 'nlVar', which includes both VAR and VECM, from the \code{tsDyn} package as well as the list from \code{MTS} package are supported.
 Besides these core functions, additional tools to calculate confidence bands for impulse response functions using
 bootstrap techniques as well as the Chow-Test for structural changes are implemented. The \code{USA} dataset is used to showcase the
 functionalities in examples throughout the package.
